# Arweave NFT Uploader

A utility that uploads all files in the 'input' folder, then creates and uploads an Arweave path manifest pointing to those images on Arweave.
Useful for NFT projects hosting on Arweave.

*Optional:* Include contract sources in the 'contracts' folder to be added a contracts section in the path manifest. The contract sources will be uploaded to Arweave, but will not be accessible through the path manifest. View the path manifest on Arweave to see the contract source URIs.
